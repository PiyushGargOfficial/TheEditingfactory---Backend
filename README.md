This is a signUp form based on nodejs(express) and mongoDB.

We can first run the mongo.exe command in our command prompt (if you have mongodb installed).

Then In the application you can register,login and even forget password with validation(using @hapi/joi) and password hashing(using bcryptjs)
There is use great npm packages like 
a. JWT
b. BcryptJS
c. Chalk
d.Nodemailer
e.OTP-generator
f. @hapi/joi
g. dotenv
h. nodemon
i.mongoose

This is a developer build , So all the error and the success messages comes in the console .
But there are ofc alert messages to inform you.
